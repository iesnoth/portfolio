# My Art Portfolio

## Disclaimer:
I used this tutorial
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmpI252DmiI&t=3340s
 for the bulk of the coding, then gutted it for my own purposes. I do not claim to have come up with all this on my lonesome.
However, I did learn A LOT from doing this, and will be documenting my notes here and throughout the code, where appropriate.


## What I learned:

- about so MANY downloadable packages, including sass for CSS
- CSS can be nested like HTML can
- target=" _blank" Attribute: specifies that this link will open a new browser tab when clicked
- rel attribute- defines the relationship between the linked resource and the current document (can include the author, links to contextual help, or in this case roreferrer, which hides referrer information when the link is clicked)
- putting &::before or after inside of a css bracket will add styling before or after the element styled.

- I was getting an error that the useEffect hook should only return a function for cleaning, so I had to alter the code. I fixed the bug based on this article: https://isotropic.co/how-to-fix-the-useeffect-must-not-return-anything-besides-a-function-warning/
- almost all of the animation stuff I didn't know. I'll go through some later date and take notes on everything.


### Notes to self
